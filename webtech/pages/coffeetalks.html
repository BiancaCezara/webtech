                <p id="hidden-paragraph-2"> A bistro-style cafe au lait is oh-so-French and a fantastic way to greet a
                    chilly morning.
                    Make it with equal parts steamed milk and strong hot coffee, for an easy, elegant breakfast with
                    flaky croissants.
                    Or enjoy it as they do at sidewalk cafes in Paris: as an afternoon treat with a square of dark
                    chocolate.
                    In France, equal parts of steamed milk and strong hot coffee are combined to make the perfect mellow
                    beverage known as a café au lait.
                    Prepare this easy recipe at home, and serve it at a traditional French breakfast with flaky
                    croissants, or as an after-brunch coffee with a single square of dark chocolate. Your guests will
                    think they've been transported to a sidewalk café in Paris.

                    we can wave goodbye to takeaway cappuccinos and say hello to long,
                    leisurely mornings holed up in a cosy coffee shop. The third wave of coffee has

                    as anyone that finding the perfect cup of joe when travelling is as essential as
                    a good meal, bar or hotel so to help lend a helping hand we’ve scoured the globe
                    for the best coffee shops. Now in its third year, you’ll find some old favourites as well
                    as new up-and-coming joints promising the perfect caffeine fix. So, without further ado,

            <p>Here you'll find out 5 things about Brazilian Coffee</p>
        </div>

        <div id="hidden-div-2">
            <p id="hidden-paragraph-5">Brazilian Coffee</p>
            <img id="hidden-div-image-3" src="../images/brazilian_coffee.jpeg">
            <p id="hidden-paragraph-6"> The best Brazilian coffees have a relatively low acidity, and exhibits a nutty
                sweet flavor, often bittersweet with a chocolaty roast taste. Most unroasted Brazilian green coffee is
                dry processed (unwashed; natural).
                The most favorable quality of a Brazilian coffee is its price - but after that, the mildness helps to
                balance out more intense coffee beans, making it a feature of many blends.</p>
